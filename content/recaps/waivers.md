What Are Waivers and why are they important?  This is one of the questions I get asked the most every season.

After your draft, the player pool isn't static. Players get injured, new players emerge, and some players just underperform. Waivers are the system that allows you to pick up these available players from the "free agent" pool and add them to your team. When you pick up a player, you usually have to drop someone from your current roster to make space. 

How Do Waivers Work?  

1.  The Waiver Period: Most leagues have a "waiver period" after games begin usually at kickoff on Sunday.   During this time, players who were dropped by other teams, or players who were on NFL rosters but not drafted in your league, become "locked" on waivers. You can't just pick them up immediately.  

2.  Submitting a Waiver Claim:  If you want one of these locked players, you submit a "waiver claim." This is essentially putting in a request for that player. You'll also need to select a player from your current roster to drop if you successfully get the waiver player.
s are how Waiver Order: This is the crucial part. When multiple teams claim the same player, the waiver order determines who gets them. There are two main types of waiver orders:  

  a.  Reverse Standings (Resets Weekly): This is the most common for beginners. At the start of each week (e.g., Tuesday night or Wednesday morning), the team with the worst record gets the first priority for any claimed players. The team with the second-worst record gets second priority, and so on. Once a team successfully claims a player, they move to the back of the waiver order. The order then resets to reverse standings for the next week. This system is designed to help struggling teams improve.  This is not my preferred option.  

  b.  Rolling Waiver (Never Resets): In this system, the waiver order is set at the beginning of the season (often reverse draft order). When a team successfully claims a player, they move to the very end of the waiver order, and everyone else moves up one spot. This order doesn't reset weekly, so if you're at the back, you stay at the back until you successfully claim a player.  
 
3.  Waiver Processing:  At a set time (e.g., Wednesday morning), all waiver claims are processed. The system goes through the waiver order, and if a team has a claim for a player, and it's their turn, they get that player. If multiple teams claimed the same player, only the team highest in the waiver order gets them.  

4.  Free Agency (After Waivers Clear):  Once waivers have processed, any players who weren't claimed (or were dropped by teams who successfully got a waiver player) become "free agents." These players can be picked up immediately on a first-come, first-served basis, without affecting your waiver priority. This is often where you'll grab a last-minute fill-in if someone gets injured right before game time.  

5.  Why Are Waivers Important?  Waivers are how you adapt your team throughout the season. All season, injuries happen, players break out, and players bust. Mastering the waiver wire is often the difference between a mediocre team and a championship contender. It's where you find those hidden gems that weren't drafted, or replace a player who isn't performing.  

In short, waivers are your weekly opportunity to improve your team by picking up available players, with a specific order to ensure fairness, especially for those who might be struggling.
