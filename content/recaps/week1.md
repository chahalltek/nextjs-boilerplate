The NFL season opener gave us everything we wanted: touchdowns, spiting, fantasy heartbreak, and at least two managers in every league already questioning all their preseason “expert” research. Daniel Jones came out looking like the sequel nobody asked for but secretly enjoyed.  He scored on every drive!  Across the field, Aaron Rodgers looked 39 going on 29, clearly enjoying being responsible once again for another Jets' loss.  The top fantasy QB of the week, Justin Fields!

But the real fantasy gods showed up with Breece Hall and Travis Etienne, who must’ve texted each other before the game like, “Wanna make everyone regret not drafting us earlier?”  After all the panic over Christian McCaffrey availability, he got the ball 31 times and shot back into the top 3.  Meanwhile, my favorite stat line of the week, Ja'Marr Chase, Nico Collins, Amon-Ra St. Brown, Brian Thomas Jr, Drake London and AJ Brown combined for 115 total yards!  Brutal.  Only Puka Nacua delivered for fantasy owners!

The waiver wire is a bit underwhelming this week, but that's not a bad thing.  It keeps us from overreacting to underwhelming start for most of our 1st and 2nd round picks.  This is a great time to keep an eye on those week 1 panic drops.

Of course, it wasn’t just the stars. A couple of sneaky WR2s and tight ends snuck into the scoring column, giving fantasy GMs that “I’m a genius” glow they’ll ride until reality smacks them next week. Week 1 reminded us that everything we thought we knew… was wrong. Which, honestly, is tradition.
