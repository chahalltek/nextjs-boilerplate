Handcuffs.  Sadly, injuries happen every season.  A hancuff in fantasy football is usually a running back's backup player if they get injured or cannot play.  During the draft, if I lucky enough to get a star running back like Bijan Robinson or Saquon Barkley, I will always snatch up their backup in a later round.   The trick is timing.  You don't want to pick them up too early, but don't wait until round 14 or 15, they could get snatched up.
