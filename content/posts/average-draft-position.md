ADP stands for average draft position.   In my ladies leagues this often doesn't matter.  Once someone drafts a kicker, quarterback or defense earlier than usual ADP, it always seems to kick off a panic and suddenly everyone needs a kicker or defense asap.  As I stated earlier, the last round is when I draft a kicker.  I'm also not in a rush to draft a defense earlier than round 13 or 14.  A great example, last season no one would touch the Minnesota Vikings defense on draft day.  Not even a huge fan like myself.   Turns out they were fantastic.  If I don't draft a top tier defense, I take the best available and often pick up a new defense every week depending on the matchup.
