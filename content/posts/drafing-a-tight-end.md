Drafting a tight end.  This is my least favorite position and I do not require a tight end in leagues I run.  It's very inconsistent position and unless you get a top tier tight end, it will be hit or miss each week.   This season if you want a top tier tight end like McBride or Bowers or Kittle, plan on getting them in round 2 or early round 3.  Otherwise, don't waste an early round draft pic on the next tier of tight ends.  Hopefully, your league lets you play a tight end or wide receiver in your 3rd slot or as a flex position.
