One of the most important things in fantasy football is managing your bench.  Sadly, injuries are a constant during the season.  It's important to know if and how many IR (injured reserved) spots your league allows.  Putting players that are designated as IR in that IR spot will free up your bench to add more healthy players to your roster.  Just know, when the player you've put on IR is taken off IR status, you'll need to drop a player to make changes to your roster or add/drop new players.  However, if a player is placed on IR and has no chance to play again this season, do not waste an IR spot on them.  Just drop them.
