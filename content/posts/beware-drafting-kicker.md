Drafting a kicker!  This often happens in my ladies in person drafts.  Around round 6 or 7 someone takes the top ranked kicker and suddenly the panic is on so many begin to snatch up kickers.    A kicker should be drafted in the final rounds.  Do not waste a mid round draft pick on a kicker.  This is when you should be stacking your bench with running backs and wide receivers or a tier 2 quarterback.
